# Gde je After?
Gde je After is a mobile app built with React Native and Supabase. It helps users find nearby parties, whether in clubs or homes, using a Tinder-like swipe feature. When both users swipe right, their locations are shared for the event. The app handles user authentication, real-time data, and party discovery.
